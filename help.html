            <p>The BHS Sailing Team is completely self-financed. The Team receives no funding from Bainbridge High School. All coaching, all boat and equipment maintenance, and all logistical support is provided by volunteers. The sailors and their families pay the substantial costs of operating the Team, traveling to regional and national regattas, acquiring the competition sailboats, and maintaining those boats during the competition season. All costs that are not funded by the individual sailors are covered by funds raised by the Friends of Bainbridge Island High School Sailing.</p>
            <p>To assist with fundraising for replacing the sailboats used in BHS Sailing Team competition and training, please donate to the Friends of Bainbridge Island High School Sailing through Bainbridge Island's One Call for All campaign. All contributions targeted specifically for the Friends of Bainbridge Island High School Sailing are transferred directly to our organization and are used exclusively for support of the Team. Any size of donation will assist, because Friends of BIHSS will also qualify to share in the One Call for All Community Fund by attaining a prescribed number of donations and collecting contributions amounting to a fixed percentage of all contributions to One Call for All programs.</p>
            <!-- One Call for All Button Here -->
            <p>Contributions for boat replacement may also be made via employer matching grant programs, and through donations of stock. Contact Friends of Bainbridge Island High School Sailing at bhssailing@gmail.com for further information on making donations through these mechanisms.</p>
            <p>Friends of BIHSS conducts community fundraising activities throughout the year, at which funds may be donated for designated Team logistical purposes. Some of these community fundraising activities include: Spartan Booster Alumni Club Merchant Discount Card sales, and SBAC sport event concessions (football, basketball).</p>
