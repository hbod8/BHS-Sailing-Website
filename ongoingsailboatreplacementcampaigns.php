            <p>The BHS Sailing Team's competition sailboats presently consist of two fleets: a primary fleet eight Flying Juniors (FJs), and a secondary fleet of six Vanguard 15s (V15s). With a typical team size often in excess of 25 sailors, all these boats are in use nearly every day during the competition season.</p>
            <p>The Friends of Bainbridge Island High School Sailing has entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Bainbridge Island Metro Park and Recreation District. Pursuant to this MOA, the Park District owns the competition sailboats (as well as the other support and sailing venue assets). In return for use of these boats in training and competition, as well as many other benefits, the Friends of BIHSS helps raise funds for sailboat acquisition. Once purchased, the sailboats are then shared between Team use during the competition season and use by double-handed training classes and clinics in the BIMPRD's Community Sailing Program.</p>
            <p>The Friends of BIHSS has adopted a Long-Term Business Plan for Fundraising for Sailboat Acquisition ( <a href="http://bhssailing.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FBIHSS.boat_.acquisition.business.plan_.4-15.pdf">Boat Aqcuisition Business Plan</a>  ) that governs replacement of these two fleets. The fundraising campaigns are distinct from one another, and they run simultaneously and in parallel.</p>
            <p>The primary fleet was replaced in 2014; the secondary fleet will be the next to be replaced. As further described below, the present secondary fleet of V15s will be replaced with Z420 sailboats. Each fleet is on a six-year replacement schedule; the culmination points are staggered so that a new primary or secondary fleet is delivered every three years. The next fleet replacement is projected for delivery in time for the spring 2017 season.</p>

            <p>Fleets of competition sailboats are replaced with new hulls and components, as new acquisition provides the best value and the most closely matched boat-to-boat competitiveness. Fleets of sailboats to be replaced are offered for sale to schools and clubs within the Pacific Northwest region. Regional resale provides economical means for smaller organizations to start or grow their own fleets. Replacement at the six-year point strikes the best balance between retained resale value and projected maintenance costs; a six-year timeframe also affords a more deliberate fundraising tempo that is sustainable for both the contributor base and manageable for the Friends of BIHSS members. This timeframe is consistent with that of the top collegiate and high school teams in the nation.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Friends of BIHSS engages in the following regular fundraising activities for boat replacement:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Community fundraising – Fourth of July build-your-own model sailboat activity</span>: A do-it-yourself boatbuilding booth at Bainbridge Island's July Fourth Street Fair.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Community fundraising – Car wash coupon sales.</span></li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Community fundraising – National Marina Day, Community Sailing</span>: Donations are solicited in return for sailing instruction and demonstration targeted at novice sailors. The event is arranged and hosted by sailing team members and BIMPRD instructors, and is held in conjunction with the City of Bainbridge Island's celebration of National Marina Day, held in late June of each year.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Community fundraising – Women's Sailing Clinic</span>: Donations are solicited in return for clinic-style sailing instruction, targeted at women sailors. The event is hosted with the assistance of female sailing team members, and is held in the summer.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Community fundraising – Scotch broom eradication</span>: Through grant funding, Friends of BIHSS is awarded funds in return for the assistance of each individual who assists during a supervised, scheduled event to eradicate Scotch broom from a designated area on the Island. Funds are donated to Friends of BIHSS at a prescribed hourly rate per volunteer.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Community fundraising – Phone-a-thon</span>: Direct telephone solicitations are made by sailing team members, targeting team/family alumni, yacht club members, prior donors, and other interested members of the boating community.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">One Call for All</span>: Friends of BIHSS is a proud partner of One Call for All.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eagle Harbor Yacht Club</span>: EHYC has made recent annual contributions for the benefit of the BHS Sailing Team through FBIHSS, with funds deriving from a yacht club annual dues allotment, as well as individual voluntary contributions solicited by EHYC on behalf of FBIHSS.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Grant funding</span>: Grant funding for boat replacement is typically sought in the closing months of one of the fundraising campaigns.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Commercial/organizational endorsement</span>: This fundraising approach focuses on selling hull endorsements for a fixed donation amount; the endorsement consists of the business/organization name permanently displayed on both sides of a new boat's hull aft of the hull numbers, using a uniform type face, letter size, and color.</li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hull naming rights</span>: The right to select a name for each new boat is offered in exchange for a fixed donation level. This opportunity is offered to individual, organizational and commercial donors. The selected name is applied to and permanently displayed on the transom of each new boat, using a uniform type face, letter size, and color.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Secondary fleet replacement</span>:  The present fleet of V15s, a hull model that is declining in use throughout the country, will be replaced by a fleet of six Z420s. This selection takes into account a variety of considerations, including suitability as a training and racing platform at the high school level; the present and projected hull selection within NWISA; preparation of BHS sailors for the competition and equipment likely encountered at the collegiate racing level; hulls likely to be used at the high school national competition level; and boat durability, availability, and price. In brief, the Z420 model is much more prevalent than the V15 in college competition and thus provides a better preparation foundation for BHS sailors; high school national championships are currently raced in C420s, Z420s and FJs, vice V15s; Z420s are more durable than V15s; and the Z420 is more exciting to sail than the C420 and FJ.</p>
            <p>The replacement Z420 fleet will be purchased in 2016, for delivery in advance of the 2017 spring season. With a total acquisition cost (including transportation and use tax) of a fleet of six complete new boats of approximately $56,000, and a projected resale value of $12,000 for the used fleet of V15s and sails, the resultant fundraising need for replacement fleet purchase in 2016 is approximately $44,000.</p>
            <p>A number of sources have been designated for raising funds for secondary fleet replacement:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One Call for All donation revenues</li>
