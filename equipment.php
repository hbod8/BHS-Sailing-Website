            <p>Here is a list of the gear you will need to be comfortable and safe as we sail this season.</p>
            <p>Mandatory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Type 3 personal flotation device (PFD) in good condition, that fits well.</li>
                <li>Waterproof jacket</li>
                <li>Waterproof pants</li>
                <li>Fleece or wool hat</li>
                <li>Sunscreen</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This gear needs to come to all regattas and practices.</p>
            <p>Other stuff you may want to have:</p>
            <ul><li>Sailing booties (you can use old sneakers and wool socks instead)</li>
            <li>Polypro inner layers</li>
            <li>Sailing gloves</li>
            <li>Sunglasses</li>
            <li>A waterproof watch is very helpful</li>
            <p>Gear may be obtained from many sources:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>There are a lot of sailors who outgrow stuff in the four years with the team and you may be able
            to hunt up some used gear.  E-mail appeals to other BHS Sailing families have worked well in the past.</p>
            <p><h3>Team Boats</h3>
            The team uses Vanguard 15 and Flying Junior (FJ) sailboats for practices and regattas.  These boats are designed
            for "two-handed" (i.e., 2 crew members) racing.</p>
            <p><h3>The Bock</h3>
            A floating / powered Boat Dock, called a "Bock," is used for local regattas and practices.</p>
