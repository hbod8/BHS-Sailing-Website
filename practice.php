            <p>For practices we launch from the public dock of Waterfront Park on Eagle Harbor (just down the hill from Town & Country Market) on Bainbridge Island.</p>
            <p>Pre-season fitness sessions run promptly after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays throughout February (excepting the week of February break when school is not in session).  These workouts are held at the Bainbridge Athletic Club.</p>
            <p>The spring competition season commences the first week of March, and continues through the end of May.   The team meets for practice immediately after school.  On Mondays practice runs from 2:00 to 5:30, and Tuesday through Thursday practice runs from 3:30 until 6 (practices end at 5:30 until the change to Daylight Savings Time).   On Fridays the team participates in an informal fitness workout from 3 to 4.  Please see the Calendar for specific dates.</p>
            <p>Team members should bring dry / warm clothing for after the practices.</p>
            <p>Light snacks are typically provided by Friends of BIHSS at each on-water practice.</p>
