            <p>The team has been blessed with several great coaches over the past years, and the team would not exist without their generous volunteer hours!</p>
            <p>The Coaches:</p>
            <p>Susan Kaseler - Susie doesn't like to talk about her accomplishments but wrote the following:</p>
            <p>"I was 17 when I began coaching, 10 when I started racing my own boat. As kids we raced 7 days a week in junior and adult regattas all summer, and in the winter crewed for the best sailors in the country (we broke up the ice in the harbor with a launch that had a door strapped on the bow)."</p>
