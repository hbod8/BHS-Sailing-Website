            </ul>
            <p>Safety is our top concern and precautions are taken to keep everyone safe. That being said, sailing can be dangerous since it involves activity on the water. All sailors are expected to wear PFDs (personal flotation devices) when in and around the water and follow the direction provided by coaches and regatta staff. There is always a danger of concussion (click <a href="http://bhssailing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Concussion.pdf">here</a> for more information) along with cuts and bruises.</p>
            <h3>Cost:</h3>
            <p>The participation fee for BHS Sailing Team is set annually. The season fee, which covers regatta fees, transportation, and related team logistics and administration costs, for the 2016 spring season is $430.</p>
            <h3>Forms:</h3>
            <h3>For Sailors:</h3>

You will need to establish a "FamilyID" account in order to complete registration, by following the instructions on this webpage.  Click on the button for "Spring 20XX Athletic Registration" and then on the button for  "Sailing" registration and complete the form.  There is no BISD fee to register for sailing as a club sport.  Physical examinations:  Please note the following process on the webpage for physical exams, as this entails an additional step:  "PHYSICAL EXAMS: A physical exam must be current within the past 24 months and signed by a physician. If the student's physical expires during the season, they will not be able to participate until a new physical exam is received.  Please bring your new or updated physical to the main office."

The BISD will provide the Coach with a list of all sailors who are fully registered. <a href="http://www.bisd303.org/Page/8981">BISD Athletics/Forms may be found here</a> .</p>
